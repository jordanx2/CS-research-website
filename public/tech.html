						<h1>Introduction</h1>
						<p>When in a development environment, and in a web development situation to be specific, there a certain amount of technical aspects involved in said development. Web development can at a high level be broken up into two categories: Front-end and back-end development – (Full-stack development: individual responsible with both front-end and back-end development. A wide variety of different languages are all associated with back-end and front-end development. </p>
				</div>	

				<div class="titled-child">
					<h1>Front End</h1>
				</div>

				<div class='tech-child'>
						<h1>Overview</h1>
						<p>When talking in the context of a web page, a front-end developer is responsible for designing and developing the overall look and feel of a website. This includes everything from the colour scheme, to the shape and size of elements and how the web page is best presented based on the device it is being accessed from – whether it be viewed on a desktop or a smart phone. Often characterized as client side programming which refers to the application being run of the clients machine.</p>

					<div class="tech-child last-child">
							<p>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a relatively easy and simple way of adding styling aspects to the webpage. Styling can come in the form of adjusting colours, fonts and spacing. CSS works incredibly well with HTML by being able to link the style sheet by writing simple code in the markup. Almost every modern day browser supports it and is a highly valuable, essential, tool at the disposal of every front-end developer. </p>
					</div>

					<div class="tech-child">
							<p>This can almost be viewed as the skeleton of a webpage, essentially without it there would be no webpage. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) defines the overall structure of a webpage. It allows for the ability to add images, text and videos to the webpage.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="tech-child last-child">
							<p>To review, HTML: Defines the overall structure of a webpage. CSS – Allows for the ability of styling techniques. JavaScript – Allows for logic to be implemented to the webpage. JavaScript lies at the core of fundamental logic based web development programming. JavaScript is a single-threaded and multi-paradigm language meaning that, it supports object oriented, declarative and imperative styles of programming. Although it is an interpreted, scripted language primarily used for webpages, it also has some use cases outside of browser based applications. For example, Node.js and Apache CouchDB. </p>
					</div>

				<div class="tech-child">
						<h1>Back-end Development</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="tech-child">
					<p>Back end development can be viewed like the behind the scenes of an application or website. Commonly referred to as server-side development, this type of development is primarily comprised of working with APIs, databases and the general logic that follows these practices. All of the working code written in the backend can be thought of like, a website interacting with a database to read and write data.</p>
				</div>

						<h1>Languages</h1>

				<div class="con1">
					<div class="tech-child last-child">
							<p>Platform independence, Object Orientated Programming, portability and multi treaded programming are just some of the features of this impeccable programming language. Java, which has no correlation with JavaScript, is a  phenomenal language when it comes to the backend. With security being at the forefront of this programming language this makes working with the backend even more better. </p>
					</div>

					<div class="tech-child">
							<p>An interpreted  server side scripting language primarily used for web development and is extremely secure. PHP (Hypertext Pre-processor) has a variety of build in useable hash functions to securely encrypt sensitive data effortlessly. As it is a interpreted language so there is no complier involved and is extremely compatible with database programming languages like mySQL and SQLite.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="tech-child last-child">
							<p>Python is almost an extremely distinguishable language in the sense that, readability is one of the main pillars of this language. Along with that, the expansive standard library of Python is vast and although this does seem to be the language of choice for most advanced technological development, it is also an asset in web development. With backend frameworks like Flask and Django, this language is a vital tool at the hands of any developer.</p>
